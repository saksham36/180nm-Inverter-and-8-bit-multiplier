# F180 nm Inverter and 8 Bit Multiplier

Designed a full custom layout using Cadence Vituoso. The layout passed the DRC, LVS and PEX tests. Considerations for minimum power and delay were prioritized in design. Additionally, an 8 bit mutiplier was designed using ModelSim and synthesized to validate theoretical results with simulations. Completed for partial fulfilment of the course *Analog and Digital VLSI Design* in BITS Pilani.
